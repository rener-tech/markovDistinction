My system is personally meaningful to me because it captures some of the challenges I face with my mental health. While this system is a severely simplified model of my day-to-day feelings, my moods can fluctuate throughout the day. The moods do seem to be related to one another, but often can be traced back to the "side of the bed" I woke up on, which can feel pretty random. Monitoring these mood fluctuations has been a crucial part of my battle with mental health issues and has allowed me to recognize some of the patterns that have led to the probabilities in my system's transition matrix. Turning these processes into pieces of visual art has been therapeutic in a way, and while the bad days can be challenging, seeing each unique piece of art that is generated by this system serves as a powerful analogy that there is beauty even in the hardest days. 

For this project, I challenged myself to get back to the basics. This was my first time working in Python since CSCI 1101, and it was a lot of fun to re-learn some of the features of the Turtle module
